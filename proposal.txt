\begin{abstract}
    Human–AI Interaction (HAI) is rapidly evolving as a central part for modern AI research. 
    As systems such as Large Language Models become embedded in our daily workflows, they begin to take active roles as multi-turn, conversational, problem-solving and decision-making agents. Despite its growing relevance and importance, HAI as a research direction currently lacks unifying foundations to fundamental aspects such as efficiency, optimality, privacy, and interpretability. 
    Hence, we propose our workshop, \textit{Foundations of Human-AI Interaction: Theory, Algorithms, Practice}, to gather researchers from different domains of research. In our proposal, we present six confirmed speakers from diverse research backgrounds, such as interpretability, uncertainty quantification and decision-making. We also include interactive games to engage the audience and showcase existing challenges in HAI research, and a panel discussion in the form of debates to foster insightful discussions. Broadly speaking, we aim to foster cross-disciplinary HAI research as a principled field of AI research with long-term impact in the foreseeable future.

\myparagraph{Description and Motivation} Collaboration is central to knowledge creation and decision making. From negotiation and collective problem-solving to scientific discovery, progress often emerges through interaction rather than isolated reasoning. As today's Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs)~\citep{grattafiori2024llama,achiam2023gpt,yang2025qwen3,team2025kimi,liu2024deepseek} and diffusion models~\citep{rombach2022high,yang2023diffusion,ho2020denoising,yang2023scalable}, become increasingly generative, capable, and versatile, they are evolving into active participants in collaborative tasks. Through multi-turn conversational exchanges, humans routinely use AI systems to explore ideas, verify reasoning, navigate uncertainty, and support decision-making across domains. Consequently, Human–AI Interaction (HAI) is taking the form of collaborative, multi-agent behavior, characterized by asymmetric capabilities, responsibilities, and incentives between humans and machines.
% Hence, this shift marks a qualitative change from earlier forms of human–computer interaction. Modern AI systems are no longer static tools or one-shot predictors; they engage in multi-turn, adaptive exchanges, influence human reasoning processes, and participate in joint decision making under uncertainty. As a result, human–AI interaction is increasingly best understood as a form of collaborative, multi-agent behavior, often involving asymmetric capabilities, responsibilities, and incentives between humans and machines.
% Collaboration has always been central to knowledge creation and decision making. From negotiation and collective problem solving to scientific discovery, progress often emerges through interaction rather than isolated reasoning.  Today, ML systems, especially LLMs, have become active participants in these interactions. Humans increasingly interact with AI through multi-round, conversational exchanges, using models to explore ideas, verify reasoning, and support decisions across domains such as research, education, software development, and healthcare.

As a result, human–AI interaction is increasingly best understood as a form of collaborative, multi-agent behavior, often involving asymmetric capabilities, responsibilities, and incentives between humans and machines.


Despite its growing importance, HAI lacks unifying foundations. %comprehensive foundations. % much of our understanding of HAI has lacked a rigorous, foundational understanding. 
Fundamental questions such as, ``When is HAI helpful in practice?''~\citep{guo2024decision}, ``What constitutes optimal collaboration under information imbalance?''~\citep{collina2026collaborative}
% when multiple parties hold different pieces of information?''~\citep{collina2026collaborative}
, ``What are appropriate notions of interpretability in collaborative systems?''~\citep{kim2025because}, or ``How can we build interactive-by-design AI systems?"~\citep{wu2025collabllm} are being raised across several research communities, yet clear, unifying answers remain elusive. Developing general principles to guide algorithm design, provide formal guarantees, and enable systematic evaluation has grown urgent. This is especially important for the ICML community: while traditional machine learning models humans as static sources of labels or feedback, modern AI systems demand novel frameworks that formally capture humans as adaptive collaborators within learning and inference loops. Addressing these questions requires diverse perspectives, from learning theory and decision theory to cognitive science and policymaking.

% are broadly raised, but have yet to arrive at a clear answer formed by our research community. As AI systems become more interactive, adaptive, and deeply integrated into decision-making workflows, there is an increasing need for complementary foundations that identify general principles capable of guiding algorithm design, providing guarantees, and supporting systematic evaluation. In parallel, classical machine learning theory and optimization have traditionally modeled humans as sources of labels or feedback, leaving open the challenge of formally capturing humans as adaptive collaborators embedded within learning and inference loops.
\myparagraph{Scope and Topics} The goal of this workshop is to establish a foundational science of HAI for modern interactive AI systems, bridging perspectives from well-established areas of research (e.g., machine learning, statistics, decision-theory, and economics) and identifying principled theory, algorithms, and practice that govern effective collaboration between humans and AI systems. To bring together researchers working across theory, algorithms, and practice to develop a shared language and tools for studying HAI, we invite contributions along three tightly connected dimensions:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1em,itemindent=0.5em, topsep=1mm, itemsep=-0.5em]
    \item \underline{Theory}: 
    foundational principles and formal models of HAI, including statistical learning theory~\citep{agarwal2025designing}, uncertainty quantification~\citep{noorani2025human,marusich2023using}, value of information~\citep{guo2025value}, Bayesian frameworks \citep{bansal2021accurateaibestteammate, steyvers}, sequential decision-making and agreement protocols~\citep{collina2025tractable,collina2026collaborative,collina2025emergent}, and characterization of human behavior~\citep{guo2024decision}.

\end{enumerate}

\myparagraph{Workshop Contributions} We summarize the key contributions of our workshop as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1em,itemindent=0.5em, topsep=1mm, itemsep=-0.25em]
\item \underline{Interchange Ideas from Diverse Areas of Research}: We aim to bring together research across theory and practice. Through such exchange, we aim to foster and build a community that develops methods with a stronger emphasis on HAI. Each of our six speakers represents an established field (i.e. uncertainty quantification, interpretability, optimization, decision-theory etc.), ensuring broad relevance for attendees and fostering cross-disciplinary dialogue. 
\item \underline{Meaningfully Engage the Larger Community}: Through dual poster sessions, spotlight talks, our proposed HAI game and panel through a Public Forum debate format, we facilitate fruitful idea exchanges, discussions and collaborations among researchers. Dedicated Q\&A sessions and networking breaks further provide opportunities to connect with speakers and researchers from both academia and industry, bringing HAI's relevance to every aspect of AI research.  
\item \underline{Establish HAI as a Research Field}: Our workshop takes a deliberate step toward building the research community and discovering open problems that can anchor HAI as a field in its own right. By convening researchers across these adjacent communities, we catalyze long-term collaborations and impact that extend well beyond the workshop itself. 
\end{enumerate}

\myparagraph{History of Workshop and Previous Workshops} 
% We are the first to organize the workshop on this topic. To the best of our knowledge, 
This is the first edition of the proposed workshop. While there exist related workshops~\citep{haic_iclr_2025_workshop,
chi2025_human_ai_augmented_reasoning,
aihci_workshop_website,multi-turn-workshop,miccai-workshop}, we are the first to emphasizes the mathematical foundation of HAI
% being fundamentally distinct in its scope and objectives.
To highlight the major difference, we mention two of the most recent workshops: The \emph{NeurIPS Workshop on Multi-Turn Interactions in Large Language Models}~\citep{multi-turn-workshop} primarily focuses on the methodology, evaluation, and multi-turn usage of LLMs. In contrast, our workshop broadens the lens to formally investigate HAI without restricting attention to a specific class of AI models. Similarly, the \emph{MICCAI Workshop on Human-AI Collaboration}~\citep{miccai-workshop}
%\footnote{\url{https://haic-miccai.github.io/}}
focuses on the benefits of HAI in healthcare, for example, with AI-assisted radiology report generation. Our workshop, instead, seeks to build a research community to establish principled, mathematical foundations of HAI.
% \footnote{\url{https://workshop-multi-turn-interaction.github.io/}}


% the mathematical foundations of HAI.

% LLMs are prominent tools for interactive tasks, but we argue the formal investigation of HAI precedes the choice of model.

% While performing tasks with LLMs is often a primary example, we argue the formal definition of HAI precedes the choice of model itself. In contrast, our workshop poses no restrictions on the AI model and emphasizes more on building a strong foundation for understanding where HAI is meaningful. Second, \textit{MICCAI Workshop on Human-AI Collaboration (HAIC)} explores how medical professionals may benefit from HAI. While the theme is aligned, it aims to explore practices in the medical domain, such as AI-assisted radiology report generation, rather than the mathematical foundation of human-AI collaboration. Overall, we seek to build a research community that establish a principled understanding of HAI. 
% Overall, we seek to fill in a gap in the existing literature of huamn-AI interaction and offer a holistic view that builds upon existing principles from mathematics, statistics, economics and decision-theory.

Procedural comment at the end. Tere is confusion regarding the review process, what’s going to be reviewed and what’s going to be determined by the area chairs, it seems that youre going to review the short papers and not the conference journal papers that have not been accepted. Then wed have on paper submission then another on paper reviews, in the paper submission is completely okay, but you dont talk about the review, then in the review you say we use openreview and then talk about for the previously accepted papers we will not review them. Now you talk about AC and review process without having talked about the review process yet. When you think about a big conference, you have Reviews ,AC, SAC and program chairs, or workshops depends on the size but you typically have program chairs and reviewers so you don’t have Area chairs. Program chair area chair senior chair is the same thing so call them program chairs. Say all of the organizers are doing everything or identify which organizers are going to the the program chairs.

\myparagraph{Interactive Engagement} To provide more interaction and engagements with our audience, we introduce two major innovations to our workshop. 1) \underline{HAI Game}: a live Human-AI collaboration game where participants experience AI-assisted decision-making firsthand. Participants will work with an AI assistant on a task where each party has access to different, incomplete information, making collaboration essential. Participants submit an initial answer, observe the AI's suggestion, and decide whether to revise. We collect responses throughout and conclude by presenting live statistics: e.g. \textit{How often did collaboration help? When did it hurt?} This transforms abstract concepts into tangible experience. 2) \underline{Debate Panel}: Rather than a traditional Q\&A panel session, we plan to divide the speakers into two teams and host a debate in ``Public Forum'' format about trending topics and popular talking points. The debate will have multiple rounds. In each round, each team will be given 5 minutes to answer questions such as: \textit{``If an AI makes a mistake in a collaborative setting (e.g., medical diagnosis, legal advice), who is responsible?'', ``Are certain elements of human judgment indispensable, or can smart machines eventually handle all decision-making?''}. Overall, we aim to create an engaging environment between the speakers and audience and find holistic answers to open-ended questions in HAI.


%a live activity where participants work with an AI to estimate the number of shapes in a briefly shown, cluttered image that is difficult to judge accurately due to the short viewing time and limited information, with participants revising their answers based on the AI’s suggestions.
