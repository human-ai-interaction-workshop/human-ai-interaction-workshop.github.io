This workshop proposal focuses on the science of interaction: human factors (reliance, trust calibration, cognitive effort, decision quality) and the algorithmic foundations needed to design interactive AI responsibly.",

  "about": {
    "text": "Modern AI systems are embedded in workflows where users ask follow-ups, negotiate meaning, revise goals, and calibrate trust over time. Yet most ML objectives and benchmarks remain static. We aim to build a common foundation that connects (i) human-centered measurement, (ii) algorithm design for interaction, and (iii) theory that clarifies what can be guaranteed about long-horizon human–AI outcomes.",
